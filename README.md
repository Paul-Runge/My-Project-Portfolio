# Paul Runge Developer Portfolio

## Overview

   This is the first project that I have built from the ground up.  It is a simple portfolio designed to highlight my evolving skills as a web developer.  Upon visiting the webpage, the first thing you will view is my name, photograph, and a navigation bar containing links.  Clicking on any of the first three links will bring you to the corresponding page section.  The fourth link will redirect to my resume.
  
   The first section is a brief biographical description.  The second contains completed and evolving projects.  As I am new in my career, this section currently contains only one project.  There are placeholders used to mimic a more complete porfolio.  As I build more pages and appications, this section will become more robust.  The third section contains contact information and links to my LinkedIn and Github pages.
  
   Currently, this is a bare bones portfolio.  It is inteded to fulfill the requirements of the Module 2 Challenge for the bootcamp I am currently attending.  In the future it will evolve into a fully functioning professional showcase.
